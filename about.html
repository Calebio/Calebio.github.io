<h2>About</h2>

<p> Hi! Thank you for stopping by. <br>
My name is Caleb, I'm a C# .Net Developer more focused on backend development <br>
in the past 2years I've been working mostly on web applications and I have used different tools like <br>
github(Source control and collaboration), SQL Server(Database), .Net Core 3.1 and entitiy frameworkcore(ORM).
Over the course of my studies at NIIT I worked with Microsoft Server 2012, Cisco networking, SQL Server, Comptia A+,Comptia N+, I also worked with <Hyper-V>
Desktop deployment tools and VMware. 
With these tools I aquired the skills in providing technical support to users on Desktop and Network devices, 
SQL Server Administration, IT Infrastructure management, Desktop Deployment
</p> 

<p> I'm self-taught and and the journey has been challenging but somehow as I have been collaborating <br>
with a small team of developers. This has made my journey less stressfull and has opened my mind to <br>
learn a lot of things, I have made backend of a lot of web applications and have provided support and upgrade <br>
to already existing websites. </P>

<p> I consider myself a life-long learner, eager to keep building on my skills and staying in tune with latest technologies.
I've been curious about a lot of things in IT and this makes me always want to learn new technologies so I've recently, been moving towards learning cloud technologies </p>

<p> After training for months with theory and hands-on projects, I have recently passed my AWS Solution Architect Associate certification exam <br>
    Cloud Services fascinates me a too because my IT background is mostly with physical servers and then having the ability to provisions a while IT Infrastructure <br>
within minutes or hours without upfront cost wow! so I move towards cloud services. And so far it has been a great journey of learning for me.
</p>

<p> <strong am looking to join a team where I get to learning from more experienced hands while also bringing value to the team with my skills, I'm eager to jump on some real-life 
 projects very curious to solve problems in the real world production environments as a Solution Architect or Cloud Support Engineer> </strong></p>
