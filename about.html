In the first 2 years of my career I built a strong background in IT Infrastructure where I built my skills on Microsoft Server 2012, Cisco networking: TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, routing and switching <br/>
SQL Server, Comptia A+,Comptia N+, Desktop deployment tools and VMware. 
Then I worked with customers by providing technical support to users on Desktop and Network devices, 
SQL Server Administration, IT Infrastructure management.

    <li>I deployed a Windows Server 2012 R2 on premises with Active Directory, DNS, TCP/IP and DHCP configured to ensure Identity management, ip address resolution to the domain name, <br/>
        and ip address leasing.</li>
        <li>I also made a server upgrade from Windows Server 2012 R2 to Windows server 2019 and the process was first simulated on a standby machine before implementing the upgrade on the production server.</li>
        <li>I provided both on-site and remote technical support for customers on their Desktop and Networking while maintaining good security and design practices.</li>
</ol>
