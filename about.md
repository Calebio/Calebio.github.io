## About

# Welcome to Caleb's Personal Page!

<p> Hi! Thank you for stopping by. <br>
My name is Caleb from Nigeria, I'm a C# .Net Developer more focused on backend development <br>
in the past 2years I've been working mostly on web applications and I have used different tools like <br>
github(Source control and collaboration), SQL Server(Database), .Net Core 3.1 and entitiy frameworkcore(ORM).
</p> 

<p> I'm self-taught and and the journey has been challenging but somehow as I have been collaborating <br>
with a small team of developers this has made my journey less stressfull and has opened my mind to <br>
learn a lot of things, I have made backend of web application and have provided support and upgrade <br>
to already existing websites. </P>

<p> I consider myself a life-long learner, eager to keep building on my skills and staying in tune with latest technologies.
I've been curious about a lot of things in IT and this makes me always want to learn new technologies so I've recently, been moving towards learning cloud technologies </p>

<p> Cloud technologies has been one of the things that fascinates me too, I'm certified as an AWS Cloud Practicioner and I want to advance towards cloud technologies because there's a lot you can achieve with cloud technologies. <br>
The next step is working towards becoming a Cloud Solution Architect to broaden my scope in cloud technologies
and to provide the best of my skills to make sure customers are satisfied </p>
