##  Relational Database Service - RDS
Relational Database Service.
A traditional database organizes data in tables and the **tables** further arrange the data in **columns**  and **rows**.
The data can be referenced by primary keys and foreign keys, databases like this is called a Relational Database.
The Relatioinal Databases we have within Amazon's RDS are : <br/>
- SQL Server
- MySQL
- Oracle 
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- Amazon Aurora.

## Advantages of RDS 
Fast: Unlike the traditional database that takes days to set up so it can function at production level, You can provision an RDS to be up and running within minutes.
Multi-AZ: You can have your primary database in one availability zone and secodary database in another availability zone
Failover capability: If one availability zone goes down due to natural disaster Amazon will switch automatically to the secondary database in another avalability zone.
Automated backups: Allows you to have backups either weekly or monthly which ever on as you have specified.
Read Replica: This is read-only copy of the primary database. 

Relational Database Service is mainly used for OLTP.
What is OLTP?
It means **Online Transaction Processing**. It is used in processing data from online transactions in real-time, e.g banking transactions, customer orders, payment and booking system. So invariably RDS is your best choice for online data processing. Unlike **OLAP**, **OLTP** is used to complete a large number of small transactions <br/>

What is OLAP? <br/>
It means **Online Analytical Processing**. It is used to process complex queries to analyze historical data e.g analyzing net figures from the past 3 years, and it takes a long time to complete.
This is achieved with Amazon Redshift.

## Difference between Multi-AZ and Read-Replica
They have almost the same functions but let's find out what is unique about them

**Multi-AZ**
The real problem multi-AZ solves is:
Multi-AZ is used to make sure of availability of data and disaster recovery, in a case where the primary database in another AZ(Let's say `us-east-1a`) goes down then Multi-AZ give the advantage of secondary database in another AZ(Let's say `us-west-2b`) becasue the database is replicated accross the two availability zones to solve the problem of making sure we always have access to our data in the database.




![Read Replica!](/assets/images/Read-Replica.jpg "Read-Replica")

**Read Replica**
The problem Read Replica solves is: 
**Read Replica** Boosts performance of the database. How does that happen?
A read-only copy of the primary database is replicated across different AZ's, it can also be replicated across regions. With **Read Replica**, you get your own unique DNS endpoint different from the endpoint of the primary database. 
**Read Replica** can be promoted to a database. You must have automatic backup in order to deploy read replica.
