## Step One: Replicate the problem and extract Logs.
- **What logs are relevant to the issue, where to find them, and how to extract them for future reference?**
- The relevant logs are the logs from the connection between the browser and the authentication server.<br/>

1. Open the browser (Chrome).<br/>

2. Open the developer tools by using the shortcut `ctrl + alt + j` or right-click on the three dots on the top-right and click on more tools → Developer tools<br/>

3. When the developer tools is open, be sure that the console tab is open.<br/>

4. Try to replicate the problem (user login) and then watch out for the errors on the console.<br/>

5. You can expand the logs shown on the Console tab.<br/>

6. If the information on the console is not enough, click on the Network tab and replicate the problem again to get the logs.
When the log comes up, right-click and save the file as HAR with content.<br/>

7. Now the logs have been extracted successfully and when the log is saved on your computer you can access it with notepad or vscode, but I think vscode is preferred to help you navigate easily with checking if there’s jwt in the request header(not on the client computer be future references).


## Step Two: Use Information from the Logs to narrow down the problem to the root cause

**First in Chrome Developer tools.**
- Check the Status Codes within the Headers to be sure there’s a successful connection between the browser and the Authentication Server. <br/>

**More information can be found in the initially extracted HAR file.**<br/>

### Possible Causes:<br/>
1. **The user credentials might be wrong but there’s no error message to tell the user.** <br/>
The case below means, there’s a successful connection between the browser and Authentication Server but the login credentials are wrong. The status code is 200 because it’s a front-end application that made the request to the Authentication server. In other situations the error code will be 403 or 401. 
So in the case of the problem statement, the credentials can be wrong and there’s no provision made to tell the user that they are using the wrong credentials to login.

2. **The Authentication Server and the Web Server might not be in the same domain therefore the Web Server does not recognize the jwt attached to the cookie.** <br/>
If the Authentication server does not reside in the same domain as the web server it can be an issue because the web server won’t recognize the jwt attached to the cookie

### Steps taken to narrow down to root cause <br/>
- Open Developer tools on the chrome browser
- Replicated the problem by signing in again
- Check the Status code, and check the Request and Response Headers.
- Take a screenshot and notes about useful information and logs for future use.
- Extract the HAR file for future reference
- Report the issue to the right team.

### Remedial action that can be taken might help fix the issue. <br/>
- Check the front-end web application to be sure that there’s a message to notify users when they login with incorrect credentials.
- Check to be sure that the Web Server and Authentication Servers are in the same domain.
